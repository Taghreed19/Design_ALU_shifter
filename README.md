# Design_ALU_shifter
The aim of this project is to design the 4-bit Function Unit Combining
Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) and a Shifter that can perform the operations given in table 1
below.
a. Use X and Y as 4 bits input and F as 4 bits output as shown in Figure 1.
b. S0,S1,S2 and S3 represent the selction code in the operation set table
c. Three statue bits V (over flow), C (carry), N (negative) and are related to arrithmatic
operations and statue bit Z (zero) is relataed to both arrithmatic and logic operation.
d. Test your designed Function Unit with necessary tables.
